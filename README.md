# FIRE Prototype
This was the proof of concept for what eventually became the FIRE website.
This Java program is the barebones logic that I developed with the goals of making a UI for it down the line. All user inputs are done in the console. For the finalized version, visit (the FIRE repository)[https://github.com/votommy/FIRE].
